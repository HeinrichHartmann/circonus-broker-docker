<!--
  Configure additional listeners, possibly with a different
  SSL configuration as well.  Circonus will only connect to
  the default port (43191) to retrieve metric data stored on
  a broker, but you may configure additional listeners to
  facilitate push submission, such as HTTPtrap, from clients
  that are unable to use the default port.

  For example, you may have an older application that is unable
  to connect to the default 43191 port because of the default
  SSL/TLS settings.  Creating a custom listener with different SSL
  options would allow this application to submit metrics to this
  broker.

  Any <sslconfig> here overrides the default sslconfig settings
  in circonus-listeners.conf, but only for listener stanzas that
  follow it in this file.

  The following sample config starts a listener on port 43201,
  permits SSLv3 to be used, lets the client choose the preferred
  cipher, and allows all "HIGH"-grade ciphers.  It uses the same
  key and certificate as the default 43191 listener.
